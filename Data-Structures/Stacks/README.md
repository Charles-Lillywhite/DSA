The Stack ADT will have the following functionalities:

- push(item) (add new item to the top of the stack)

- pop (remove item from top of stack, LIFO)

- peek (returns the next item in LIFO ordering)

- len() (returns number of items in stack, will need dunder for abstract object)

- isempty (returns True if stack has no length, else False)

The Stack class in 'Basic-Stack.py' illustrates the object-oriented strategy of composition (the Stack * ***has a*** *  list)
