In a standard array, item are stored sequentially in a contiguous block of memory.
In a linked list this is not the case; **each 'node' contains the value of
the data item, as well as a pointer to the memory location of the next element.**

Linked lists are a simple data structure for storing a sequential collection.
Unlike a standard Python list, it will allow us to insert at the beginning
quickly. The idea is to store the items in individual objects called nodes.
A special node is the head of the list (we may also denote the tail of the list, and include pointers in both directions).
Each node stores a reference to the next node in the list.
