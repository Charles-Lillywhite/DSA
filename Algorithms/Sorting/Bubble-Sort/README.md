BUBBLE SORT:
- The simplest sorting algorithm, that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.
- Once a COMPLETE PASS has been made with no swaps, the algorithm terminates and the array is sorted.
- Worst case time complexity is &Omicron;(n^2), for the case where the array is already sorted in **reverse order**.
(Best case is &Omega;(n) when array is already sorted and early return is included).
